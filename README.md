# AWS-CDK-ECS-Infra

This repository contains AWS CDK infrastructure code for deploying a complete ECS (Elastic Container Service) solution using **AWS Fargate**. The infrastructure setup includes the following:

1. **VPC Setup**: A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is created to define a secure network for your ECS services.
   
2. **ECS Fargate Setup**: The repository includes the configuration to deploy services on **ECS Fargate**, allowing you to run containers without managing the underlying infrastructure.
